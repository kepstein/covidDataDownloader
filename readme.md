# Covid19 Data Downloader 

This is a lightweight data downloading pipeline. We grab data from [New York Times' GitHub repo for Covid 19 data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data). 
The project uses the Serverless Framework to deploy a Lambda Function and a CloudWatch Event to trigger that Lambda
Function every 4 hours.
